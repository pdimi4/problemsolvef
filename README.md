## Task C - Implement the linked list

As you should have found, there is an abstract class, `AQueue`, in this repository.
For this lab, you are tasked with implementing a linked list queue.
This will involve creating a class called `LinkedListQueue` which extends the aforementioned `AQueue` class.

> [!TIP]
> Take a look at the Javadoc in the `AQueue` class.

## Task D - Use your queue

This repository includes a `Main` class and method.
You can use this to test your queue.
It should run perfectly.

Once it starts to run perfectly, try your own versions.
Perhaps make a Person class and create a LinkedListQueue with Persons.
